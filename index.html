                    before, my name is Andrew Dean and I am a current full stack web development student enrolled in The
                    University of Pennsylvania's Coding Bootcamp. For the time being this portfolio will house my most
                    recent projects associated with that program and any side projects I complete that will accurately
                    reflect my growth throughout the program. I am going to apply the skills attained in this program to
                    further my career. Peruse the projects at your leisure and thank you for visiting". -AD
